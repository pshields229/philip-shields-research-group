Dr Philip Shields (PI) is a Senior Lecturer in Electronic & Electrical Engineering at UoB and leads a research group in the areas of III-Nitride semiconductors and emerging nanofabrication techniques. Dr Shields has worked on the application of nanofabrication to semiconductor devices since 2007; initially in order to improve the extraction efficiency of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using photonic quasicrystals, and more recently in fabricating and measuring the properties of nanorod-based light-emitting diodes, for emission in the visible and the UV. To facilitate this work, he has become an expert in nanolithography: electron-beam lithography, nanoimprint lithography, and plasma dry etching. He is on the management committee of the David Bullett Nanofabrication Facility and the UK Nitrides Consortium.
Dr Shields led a £2.4M  EPSRC Manufacturing the Future activity which equipped a dedicated room within the David Bullett Nanofabrication Facility with state-of-the-art large-area nanolithography equipment, including the only Displacement Talbot Lithography (DTL) system in the UK. Within this research programme, Dr Shields’ research group has used this system to extend the lithography platform and manufacture nanoengineered semiconductors. 
The group has developed a lithography simulation platform in order to explore the resolution limit. The group demonstrated the batch processing of patterned sapphire substrates to increase the efficiency of UV LEDs , developed core-shell light-emitting diodes ,, patterned material for the growth of site-controlled nanorods  and selective sublimation of GaN to make nano-laser arrays ,, fabricated nanotube microcavities  and developed a waveguide-integrated GaN distributed Bragg reflector cavity. 
Numerous collaborations arose from the patterning work that demonstrates its impact: with the Ferdinand-Braun-Institut, Technische Univ. Berlin (Germany), CNRS-CRHEA, Univ. Clermont Auvergne (France) and Univ. of Cambridge. The research culminated in the invention of a more advanced version of DTL, called 'Double' Displacement Talbot Lithography (D2TL), which allows the direct writing of complex periodic patterns, thus defeating many of the previous limitations of single-exposure DTL.
