Philip Shields is a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor) in the Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering at the University of Bath, UK. His research interests are in the nanoengineering of semiconductor materials predominantly in the area of group III-V optoelectronics.

Dr Shields has worked on the application of nanofabrication to semiconductor devices since 2007; initially in order to improve the extraction efficiency of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) using photonic quasicrystals, and more recently in fabricating and measuring the properties of nanorod-based light-emitting diodes, for emission in the visible and the UV. The latter led to his invitation to contribute to the [2020 UV emitter roadmap][1]. To facilitate this work, he has become an expert in nanolithography: electron-beam lithography, nanoimprint lithography, and plasma dry etching. He has been Co-I on several other [EPSRC][4] and EU research grants and is on the management committee of the [David Bullett Nanofabrication Facility][2] and the [UK Nitrides Consortium][3].

Dr Shields led a Â£2.4M  EPSRC Manufacturing the Future activity (two grants: EP/M015181/1 and EP/M022862/1) which equipped a dedicated room within the David Bullett Nanofabrication Facility with state-of-the-art large-area nanolithography equipment, including the only Displacement Talbot Lithography (DTL) system in the UK.
